# ForestFireDetection
This project demonstrates a machine vision-based approach for detecting forest wildfires using video analysis. It integrates color features, motion detection, and OpenCV techniques to detect fire in videos, particularly those captured by UAVs (drones).

üß† Project Overview
The application is built using Python's tkinter for GUI and OpenCV for image processing. It allows users to:

Upload a forest surveillance video.

Process the video to detect fire using HSV color thresholds.

Analyze motion between video frames to reinforce detection accuracy.

üñ•Ô∏è Features
GUI for uploading videos and running detection.

Fire detection based on HSV color space filtering.

Motion detection using frame differencing and contour analysis.

Real-time video display with fire detection labels.
